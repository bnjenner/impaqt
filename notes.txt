Density-Based Spatial Clustering as a Method of Gene Isoform Expression Quantification 

Ok so here is the idea, basically just get the 5' end of every read in the genome, 
	do a constrained DBSCAN algorithm with a moving window to set the epsilon paramter (min dist param is set by randomly sampling read lengths),
	this will give us an assignment vector that can then be used to overlap genes. 

	Now, how do we deal with noise... From the distribution of GC content, we can see that there are certain reads
	that fall outside normal range. I think this needs to be considered for quantification purposes. 
	Also, is the noise in noisier regions even valuable for quantification? How do we eliminate this?


Trust yourself here, the code is actually not that confusing.
