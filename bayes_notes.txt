	Salmon uses a GC bias defined by the likelihood of GC in foreground model vs background.
		In our case, foreground can be clusters and background can be UTR.
		Is the ratio between these two things the sequencing Bias? Does this apply
			to a semi targeted sequencing method? Like we are doing the reverse priming,
			using oligo dTs (but this selects for polyA), upstream should be the UTR
			which should just be randomly sampled from there. 

		HOW TF DO WE DEFINE A BACKGROUND? we are gonna need to get clever.

So want to estimate true expression of transcript, how do we do that?

Well in the MISO paper, expression estimates are dependent upon length bias
	
	P(Psi | R) = [ P(R | Psi) * P(Psi) ] / P(R)

	Psi = transcript expression
	R = Reads

	


	P(Psi initial) should be proportion of reads in clusters
	P(R) probability of given reads occuring, dependent on base expression (E)
		and GC bias (GC).

	R is depednent on E which is dependent on GC

	



	P(Psi | R) = P(R 

| Psi_I) * P(Psi_I)


"To compute the posterior, we need to consider all possible assignments of every read to each isoform and use the probabilities defined above to score these assignments:"




How likely read came from transcript given the distance from transcript, the GC bias factor, and the prior
	P(R|Exp(D, G)) * P(Exp(D, G))
	


!!!! Ok salmon just uses it to update estimates, so we can just remove it from the bayes shit.

			Ok, what if we had one of the isoforms be not an isoform at all? Put a pin in that honestly

	Back to business

	P(Psi) = prior assumption, both transcripts are expressed so this will be 1

	P(I|Psi) = likelihood of isoform given it's expressed (ratio of transcript core points adjusted for by GC bias)

	P(R|I) = likelihood of read originating from isoform (1 - (dist / sum of distances to other transcripts))

	= P(I|R)

P(I | R) ~=~ P(R | I(0)) * P(I(0))
